# Hackathon @ J On The Beach 2017

This is the repository for the Valo [Hackathon](https://jonthebeach.com/hackathon) and [J On The Beach 2017](https://jonthebeach.com/).

The purpose of the hackathon is *hackhing the J On The Beach conference*. For doing so, we will use [Valo](https://valo.io/) as the core real-time analytics engine. We will feed Valo from IoT and mobile devices. Then we will create data visualizations that help us get insights about the J On The Beach itself.
