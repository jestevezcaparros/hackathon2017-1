# Why would you like to try it out ?

This project collects geolocation points from Valo which are emitted from the mobile [app](https://github.com/ITRS-Group/hackathon2017/tree/master/valo/src/mobile_app_js/ValoExample) and then renders on an interactive real time map. Using this experimental app will allow you to visualize and track attendees as they move across "La Termica" zone.

# What do I need ?

Before you start, just make sure your local setup includes [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version >=6) and your favorite IDE/editor. That should be enough, so easy!

# How to kick it off ?

If just want to play with it but not interested in hacking it, then follow this easy steps

- Clone this Github repository: `git clone https://github.com/ITRS-Group/hackathon2017.git`
- Install local dependencies and run the project launcher script: `cd hackathon2017 && npm run start:viz`

After running last command, your default browser should opens up displaying the map. Otherwise, something might have failed on steps above. Please talk to an organizer for help.

# Hmm ... I want more!

Fantastic!, you've got to the nice part. Issue the next command `npm run make:viz` on your terminal and run to your favorite IDE or editor. Now, please continue to our [tutorials](https://github.com/ITRS-Group/hackathon2017/wiki/Visualisations) section. Thank you and enjoy!
