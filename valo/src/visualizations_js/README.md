# What is this project about?

This project collects geolocation points from Valo which are emitted from the mobile [app](https://github.com/ITRS-Group/hackathon2017/tree/master/valo/src/mobile_app_js/ValoExample), plus a bunch of other data (IOT board temperature sensors data and #JOTB tweets), and then renders them on an interactive real time map.

# What do I need?

Before you start, just make sure your local setup includes [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version >=6) and your favorite IDE/editor. That should be enough, so easy!

# How do I run it?

If just want to play with it but not interested in hacking it, then follow this easy steps

- Clone this Github repository: `git clone https://github.com/ITRS-Group/hackathon2017.git`
- Install local dependencies `cd hackathon2017 && npm run prelaunch:viz`
- Build solution `npm run make:viz`
- Run the project launcher script: `npm run launch:viz`

After running the last command your default browser should opens up displaying the map.
If you have any problem, please talk to an organizer for help.
